# TASK-4

Breast Cancer Prediction Using Logistic Regression

This project contains a complete machine learning pipeline to classify breast tumors as malignant or benign using logistic regression. It is built on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset and emphasizes both model performance and interpretability.

Project Highlights:-

* Logistic Regression Implementation:

A robust binary classification model trained on 30 medical features to predict tumor type.

* Model Evaluation:

Includes confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC-AUC score with visualizations.

* Sigmoid Function Explained:

Clear visualization and educational breakdown of how the sigmoid function transforms the model's raw output into a meaningful probability.

* Threshold-based Decision Making:

Customizable classification threshold (e.g., 0.6) with individual sample analysis for deeper insight into predictions.

* Sample Inference:

Manual computation of the model's logit output ùëß,sigmoid transformation, and final decision ‚Äî explained step by step for interpretability.
